> number: Creates a numeric input field.

> checkbox: Creates a checkbox for selecting multiple options.

> radio: Creates a radio button for selecting a single option.

> file: Creates a file upload control.

###  **name: Specifies the name of the input field. The name is used to identify the input field when the form is submitted.**

### **value: Sets the initial value of the input field. This attribute is used to pre-fill the input with a default value.**

### **placeholder: Provides a hint or example text that is displayed in the input field before the user enters any value.**
